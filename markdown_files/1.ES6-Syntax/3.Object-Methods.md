abstract: Apart from array, object is also a building block of Javascript. This language also provides some methods to help developers work with this data structure.

Objects are mappings between different key-value pairs. Keys must be a string in JavaScript (specifying anything
besides a string will convert the key to a string first), but
values can be anything. The easiest way to specify an object is with an object literal, specified
using braces as follows:

```typescript
const dog = {
  legs: 4,
  ears: 2,
  eyes: 2,
  name: 'John',
}

console.log(dog.name) // 'John'
console.log(dog['legs']) // 4
```

However, array and string are also special types of object, since they also
contain mapping between key-value pairs (with key being the index number).

```typescript
const seasons = ['Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall', 'Winter']

console.log(seasons[0]) // 'Spring'
console.log(season['0']) // Still 'Spring'! No ERROR!

const username = 'John Do'
console.log(username[0]) // 'J'
console.log(username['0']) // Still 'J'! No ERROR!
```

Object methods refer to some special methods that can be applied on an
object to perform some certain operations. These operations could be:
getting all the keys of an object, getting all the values, getting all
key-value pairs, etc.

## The Object.keys()

**Usage:**
`Object.keys()` function is used to get all
the keys of an object in the form of an array of string.

**Example:**

```typescript
const customerAge = {
  John: 18,
  Mary: 20,
  Chloe: 35,
}

const customersName = Object.keys(customerAge) // ['John', 'Mary', 'Chloe']

const customersUnder30 = customersName.filter((name) => customerAge[name] < 30)

console.log(customerUnder30) // ['John', 'Mary']
```

## The Object.values() method

**Usage:** `Object.values()` is
used to return all values within an object in a form of an array.

**Example:**

```typescript
const customerAge = {
  John: 18,
  Mary: 20,
  Chloe: 35,
}

let customerUnder30Count = 0
Object.values(customerAge).forEach((age) => {
  if (age < 30) {
    customerUnder30Count++
  }
})

console.log(customerUnder30Count) // 2
```

## The Object.entries() method

**Usage:**
`Object.entries()` is used to return all
key-value pairs within an object. Each pair will be in the form of an array,
the first item of the array is the key, and the second one is the
corresponding value of that key.

**Example:**

```typescript
const customerAge = {
  John: 18,
  Mary: 20,
  Chloe: 35,
}

Object.entries(customerAge).forEach((customer) => {
  const [name, age] = customer
  console.log(name + ' is ' + age + ' years old!')
})

// John is 18 years old
// Mary is 20 years old
// Chloe is 35 years old
```

**Usage:**
`Object.assign()` is used to copy the content
of an object to another object. If the 2 objects have some same keys, the
values of those keys in the target object will be overwritten by the
corresponding values in the source object.

**Example:**

```typescript
const target = {}

const person1 = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 25,
  sex: 'M',
}

const person2 = {
  name: 'Mary',
  age: 30,
  sex: 'F',
}

Object.assign(target, person1)

console.log(target) // { name: 'John', age: 25, sex: 'M' }

Object.assign(target, person2)

console.log(target) // { name: 'Mary', age: 30, sex: 'F' }

// Object.assign() also accepts more than 2 arguments
// The first argument is always the target, then the subsequent arguments will be 'paste' onto the target one by one from left to right
Object.assign(target, person1, person2)

console.log(target) // { name: 'Mary', age: 30, sex: 'F' }
```
